# Gaslight Conversions

## What This Is

A small e-commerce website for Gaslight Conversions, a family business that sells conversion kits and fixtures for converting old gas-powered outdoor wrought iron lamps to electric. The site serves homeowners and commercial customers who want to preserve the classic look of their outdoor lighting while modernizing the power source. Carolyn is rebuilding her dad's long-standing site on a modern stack.

## Core Value

Customers can find the right kit, understand how it works, and buy it with confidence — on any device.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Product catalog showcasing conversion kits, fixtures, and components (under 10 products)
- [ ] Individual product pages with descriptions, photos, and PayPal buy buttons
- [ ] Installation guides / how-to content for customers
- [ ] Benefits page explaining why to convert gas to electric
- [ ] About / origin story of the business and the invention
- [ ] FAQ page answering common customer questions
- [ ] Contact form for customer inquiries
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design throughout
- [ ] Modern redesign preserving mid-century warmth (orange + navy palette, classic feel)

### Out of Scope

- Shopping cart / multi-item checkout — PayPal handles this via individual buy buttons
- CMS / admin panel — Carolyn handles all updates directly
- Mail order form — replacing with online-only purchasing
- Sitemap page — not needed on modern sites

## Context

- **Current site:** gaslightconversions.com — late-90s table-based HTML design, orange and navy color scheme, not mobile responsive
- **Current products visible:** Outdoor Lighting Fixtures (lantern with glass panes + eagle mount), Low Voltage Lighting Kit (high/low voltage conversion), Gaslight Base Unit (slides over pole)
- **Product categories on current site:** gaslight conversion kits, replacement bulbs, gaslight components
- **Tagline:** "Brighten Up Your Profits..." — suggests commercial customers in addition to homeowners
- **Payments:** PayPal — keep as-is, embedded buy buttons per product
- **Visual direction:** Preserve mid-century character (orange, navy, warm tones) with a modern, clean layout
- **Carolyn manages updates** — no CMS needed, she edits code directly

## Constraints

- **Payments:** PayPal only — no new payment processor
- **Updates:** Carolyn-managed — no admin dashboard required
- **Products:** Under 10 SKUs — no complex inventory management needed

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Keep PayPal for checkout | Dad uses it, customers know it, no migration risk | — Pending |
| No CMS | Carolyn handles updates, adds complexity without benefit for this scale | — Pending |
| Custom-coded site | Full control over design fidelity and performance; open to best approach | — Pending |
