## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: Astro 5.x + Tailwind CSS 4.x + Netlify — static site, no backend, Netlify Forms for contact
- Payments: PayPal hosted buttons per product (keep as-is, verify API version before Phase 3)
- No CMS: Carolyn manages updates directly in code; Content Collections as data layer

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: Verify Astro 5.x + Tailwind 4.x integration approach before starting (CSS-first config differs from v3)
- Phase 3: Verify PayPal current recommended embed method before writing any PayPal code — legacy webscr endpoint may be deprecated
- Phase 1: Content quality unknown until audit — determines how much new asset production is needed before design
